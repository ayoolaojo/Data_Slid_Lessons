            The S25 Ultra looks almost identical to the S24 Ultra, and from a
            hardware perspective, it is. But this doesn't stop it from being the
            best phone you can buy right now, provided money is no object. There
            are now even fewer weaknesses than before, with even more processing
            power, small but noticeable camera improvements.

              The OnePlus 13 takes what made the OnePlus 12 so great and makes it
              even better. This is the best phone OnePlus has ever made, and up
              there with the finest around right now. What makes it so good? It's a
              brilliant combination of top-class hardware, slick software and
              extensive support, meaning the phone could be your main phone for many
              years to come.

            If photography is your top priority, there's no better phone than the
            Xiaomi 15 Ultra right now. When it comes to stills, there's no handset
            that does it better. Alongside a trio of 50Mp lenses (main, ultrawide
            and 3x telephoto), you also now get a 200Mp periscope with 4.3x
            optical zoom. That enables some of the best zoom shots you'll find on
            any phone.

            After Oppo decided not to release its Find X6 and Find X7 series
            flagships outside China, the Find X8 series marks a triumphant return
            to Europe. Both the Find X8 and Find X8 Pro are excellent phones, but
            the latter has a slight upper hand. It's powerful, good-looking,
            offers amazing battery life and has plenty of software perks.

            If none of the options above appeal to you, a Pixel 9 is probably your
            best bet. And if you want the absolute best experience, the
            newly-branded Pixel 9 Pro XL is the one to go for. While not quite the
            standout phone we saw with the Pixel 8 Pro, the 9 Pro XL still
            delivers a compelling experience in almost all key areas.
